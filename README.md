## Learning Outcomes
This project brought together most of the technologies and all of the skills that I have acquired of the course of my time
at DigitalCrafts. I learned the Ionic framework for this project as well as ui-routing which were not taught at DigitalCrafts.
Learning the additional technologies was the hardest part of the project. Integrating as many technologies as I did was also a great
learning experience and is more real world. Software is not written in isolation and often many languages are used. My goal was 
to use as many skills as I could and learn as much as I could.
